Explain about the problem we had with the data.
Our training was really slow in the beginning. we were doing transforms on the data every time it was loaded and also a 90 deg rotation.
For lauching the train pipeline to see if it was working we decided for now to remove the rotation. And decided to do the the resize as
 a pre process and save it to save time during training
This allowed us to reduce by a lot training time.
