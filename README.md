# Skin Cancer Segmentation  
_Final Project | Deep Learning Course, Technion_

## Overview

This repository contains the code and experiments for our final project in the Deep Learning course at the Technion. The goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art deep learning model for **automatic segmentation of skin lesion attributes** in dermoscopic images, with the broader aim of assisting early melanoma detection.

We participated in the ISIC 2018 Challenge (Task 2: Lesion Attribute Detection), working to segment five clinically important dermoscopic attributes:
- Pigment network
- Negative network
- Streaks
- Milia-like cysts
- Globules (dots)

Our best model achieved a **top-7 leaderboard result** on the ISIC 2018 Task 2 challenge, demonstrating strong performance compared to international teams and established methods.

## Project Highlights

- **Modern U-Net Variants:** Implemented and compared classic U-Net, Residual U-Net, Attention U-Net, and a novel U-Net with a ConvNeXt-Tiny encoder plus residual and attention blocks in the decoder.
- **Advanced Training Pipeline:** Extensive experiments with loss functions (Dice, Jaccard, BCE), optimizers, learning rate schedulers, and data augmentation.
- **Open, Reproducible Science:** All code and configs are included. Experiments are tracked via YAML configuration files for reproducibility.
- **Competitive Results:** Our ConvNeXt-based model achieved a test Dice score of 0.3213 and Jaccard index of 0.2052 on the ISIC 2018 challenge test set.

## Dataset

We use the [ISIC 2018 Task 2](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/isic-2018-task-2) dataset:
- **2594 training images** (RGB, variable sizes, with 5 attribute masks per image)
- **100 validation images** (for model selection)
- **1000 test images** (for challenge submission)

Each image has up to 5 binary masks, one per lesion attribute.  
**Note:** The dataset is highly imbalanced â€” some attributes are very rare.

## Data Distribution

The ISIC 2018 Task 2 dataset is highly imbalanced across the five target attributes. The following pie charts illustrate the distribution of attribute masks in the training and validation sets:

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skinCancerSegmentation.git
   cd skinCancerSegmentation
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:**  
   Recommended: use Conda or virtualenv. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the data:**  
   Download the ISIC 2018 Task 2 data and place it in the appropriate data folder. The folder structure should be:
   ```
   data/
     train/
     val/
     test/
     ...
   ```

---

## Training

You can train your model of choice with a specified configuration YAML file:
```bash
python train.py --yaml ./model_params/unet_convnext_configs/config1_unet_convnext.yaml
```
- Example configs are provided in `model_params/unet_convnext_configs/`.
- All training options (model type, scheduler, optimizer, batch size, etc.) are set via the YAML config.

---

## Testing

After training, evaluate your model on the test set using a saved checkpoint:
```bash
python test.py --checkpoint images/top3_convnext_regular_loss/2025-07-05_15-37-31_unet-convnext-attention_epoch23_best_0.2052_jaccard_reducelr.pth --yaml model_params/unet_convnext_configs/config1_unet_convnext.yaml
```
- Replace `--checkpoint` and `--yaml` with your own paths if different.

---

## Visualization

To visualize model predictions on a single image from the dataset:
```bash
python -m utils.visualize --checkpoint images/top3_convnext_regular_loss/2025-07-05_15-37-31_unet-convnext-attention_epoch23_best_0.2052_jaccard_reducelr.pth --yaml model_params/unet_convnext_configs/config1_unet_convnext.yaml --image-index 78 --train 0
```
- Use `--image-index` to specify which image to visualize.
- Use `--train 1` to visualize a training image, `--train 0` for a validation/test image.

### Results

- **Best model:** U-Net with ConvNeXt-Tiny encoder, residual and attention decoder  
  - Validation Dice: 0.2875 | Jaccard: 0.1829  
  - Test Dice: 0.3213 | Jaccard: 0.2052 (ISIC Challenge Test Set)

Graphs and qualitative results are available in the `figures/` folder and in the report.

## Training Progress

The following graph shows the **training and validation score as a function of epochs** for our best-performing model:

## Qualitative Results

Below are example predictions of our best model on two different test images from the ISIC 2018 dataset. Each shows the original dermoscopic image, the ground truth attribute masks, and the corresponding predicted masks produced by our U-Net ConvNeXt-Attention model.

## Architecture

- **Baseline U-Net**: Standard U-Net for medical image segmentation
- **Residual U-Net**: U-Net with residual blocks in encoder/decoder
- **Attention U-Net**: U-Net with attention gates on skip connections
- **ConvNeXt U-Net**: Pretrained ConvNeXt-Tiny encoder, attention & residual decoder

All models output a 5-channel mask (one per attribute) for each input image.

## Augmentation

Augmentations used (during training):
- Random horizontal & vertical flips
- Rotations
- Channel-wise normalization (mean/std from ISIC data)
