# Skin Cancer Segmentation  
_Final Project | Deep Learning Course, Technion_

## Overview

This repository contains the code and experiments for our final project in the Deep Learning course at the Technion. The goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art deep learning model for **automatic segmentation of skin lesion attributes** in dermoscopic images, with the broader aim of assisting early melanoma detection.

We participated in the ISIC 2018 Challenge (Task 2: Lesion Attribute Detection), working to segment five clinically important dermoscopic attributes:
- Pigment network
- Negative network
- Streaks
- Milia-like cysts
- Globules (dots)

Our best model achieved a **top-7 leaderboard result** on the ISIC 2018 Task 2 challenge, demonstrating strong performance compared to international teams and established methods.

## Project Highlights

- **Modern U-Net Variants:** Implemented and compared classic U-Net, Residual U-Net, Attention U-Net, and a novel U-Net with a ConvNeXt-Tiny encoder plus residual and attention blocks in the decoder.
- **Advanced Training Pipeline:** Extensive experiments with loss functions (Dice, Jaccard, BCE), optimizers, learning rate schedulers, and data augmentation.
- **Open, Reproducible Science:** All code and configs are included. Experiments are tracked via YAML configuration files for reproducibility.
- **Competitive Results:** Our ConvNeXt-based model achieved a test Dice score of 0.3213 and Jaccard index of 0.2052 on the ISIC 2018 challenge test set.

## Dataset

We use the [ISIC 2018 Task 2](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/isic-2018-task-2) dataset:
- **2594 training images** (RGB, variable sizes, with 5 attribute masks per image)
- **100 validation images** (for model selection)
- **1000 test images** (for challenge submission)

Each image has up to 5 binary masks, one per lesion attribute.  
**Note:** The dataset is highly imbalanced â€” some attributes are very rare.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skinCancerSegmentation.git
   cd skinCancerSegmentation
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:**  
   Recommended: use Conda or virtualenv. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the data:**  
   Download the ISIC 2018 Task 2 data and place it in the appropriate data folder. The folder structure should be:
   ```
   data/
     train/
     val/
     test/
     ...
   ```

### Training

Train your model of choice with a specified configuration:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/your_config.yaml --save_dir runs/your_run_name
```
Example configs are provided in `configs/`.  
You can choose architectures, optimizers, schedulers, batch size, etc., via YAML files.

### Evaluation

After training, you can run inference or evaluate on validation/test sets:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model-path runs/your_run_name/best_model.pth --data-path data/val/
```

### Results

- **Best model:** U-Net with ConvNeXt-Tiny encoder, residual and attention decoder  
  - Validation Dice: 0.2875 | Jaccard: 0.1829  
  - Test Dice: 0.3213 | Jaccard: 0.2052 (ISIC Challenge Test Set)

Graphs and qualitative results are available in the `figures/` folder and in the report.

## Architecture

- **Baseline U-Net**: Standard U-Net for medical image segmentation
- **Residual U-Net**: U-Net with residual blocks in encoder/decoder
- **Attention U-Net**: U-Net with attention gates on skip connections
- **ConvNeXt U-Net**: Pretrained ConvNeXt-Tiny encoder, attention & residual decoder

All models output a 5-channel mask (one per attribute) for each input image.

## Augmentation

Augmentations used (during training):
- Random horizontal & vertical flips
- Rotations
- Channel-wise normalization (mean/std from ISIC data)
